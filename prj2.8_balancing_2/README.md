# prj2.8 balancing 2

Balancing test #2

- Going forward and backward is controlled by changing target angle.
- Direction is changed by adding to and subtracting from PWM.
- IR is used to change target angle and direction in running time.
- 2 cascaded PID is used to control motor PWM, inspired by https://www.jjrobots.com/projects-2/b-robot/
- using VNH5019 motor driver
